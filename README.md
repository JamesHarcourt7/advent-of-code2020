Hi! This repository will contain my attempts at each challenge for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzle advent calendar, released every year for the festive season. I'll be competing with my coursemates this year on a private leaderboard- so hopefully I'll stay motivated to get as far as I can.

Best of luck to anyone else participating this year. :christmas_tree:
